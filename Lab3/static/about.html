                                        The Transparent TV is one of the most interesting projects I have worked on. When switched off it works like glass. 
                                        It can be also customized to work like a mirror when off. On turning on the TV screen comes to life.

                        It comes six months after our team managed to send the smell of champagne and macarons from New York to Paris with 
                        an iPhone app using a device called the Scentee Duo. The system consists of a Scentee app which allows users 
                        to create a Scentee with a smell created out of a palette of 32 available scents that can be combined in 
                        300,000 possible combinations. The Scentee can then be sent to the oPhone hardware - a device which is able 
                        to recreate the smell.

                        The flying car is the perfect commuter's dream. With a seating capacity for two people, and ground speeds upto 80 mph, this car can
                        help you reach your destination no matter how much traffic is on the road. Once you hit the "air" on this car, the GPS navigates across
                        fields and lakes and avoids tall buildings, at the same time, taking care of wind speeds and direction to save fuel whenever possible.

                        The boat has enough capacity to store oxygen for 2 people upto 8 hours. Since you are not swimming, you consume much less oxygen and hence
                        can continue to remain underwater for a longer period of time. It can go upto 1000 feets under the surface, and has emergency ejectors to shoot
                        up both passenger seats as capsules, in case of emergency. The glass is shatter proof from the water pressure as well as jaws of sharks

                        This flashlight converts the kinetic enegy of the person holding the light and walking and stores that in a small cell inside the body.
                        This cell provides the power to the bulb. Usually we walk when holding a flashlight, and this one utilizes the extra energy that we dissipate
                        when walking. If you go for a run every day, just clip the light with your belt. A 30 mins jogg would be enough to power it for 4 hours.

                        The device utilizes the air chamber present on the tip of every egg. When pressurized, the air forces itself between the shell and the skin
