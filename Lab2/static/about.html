                <p>
                    The Big Bang Theory is an American television sitcom created by Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady.The show is primarily centered
                    on five characters living in Pasadena, California: Leonard Hofstadter and Sheldon Cooper, both physicists
                    at Caltech, who share an apartment; Penny, a waitress and aspiring actress who later becomes a pharmaceutical
                    representative and who lives across the hall; and Leonard and Sheldon's similarly geeky and socially
                    awkward friends and co-workers, aerospace engineer Howard Wolowitz and astrophysicist Raj Koothrappali.
                    The geekiness and intellect of the four men are contrasted for comic effect with Penny's social skills
                    and common sense.
